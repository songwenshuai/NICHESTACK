IP Multicast changes have been made to files in the following directories:

INET
IPMC
MISCLIB
TCP
DOSLIB

All the changes are contained within a #define IP_MULTICAST.  This flag 
must be set in the ipport.h_h file. 
In the makefile, the LIB directive needs to include IPMCLIB.
A clean build needs to be done to include the IP Multicast capability.

Steps for building IP Multicast
----------------------------------

1.  Pkunzip tcpsrc16.zip and do a "nmake clean" in the dosmain directory 
followed by an nmake in the dosmain directory.

2.  Execute webport and run the "iface" command.  This should show the
Multicast address 224.0.0.1 on every interface that has multicast capability
configured on it. 

3.  Multicast capability is configured on an interface by compiling in an 
address for n_mcastlist routine in the nets interface structure.  In the
default build, this routine is defined in dosmain\main.c.  The default 
routine currently does nothing.  The idea behind this routine is to 
have it be defined in the driver.  The driver will then use in_multi
structure (as passed into n_mcastlist routine) to set ethernet multicast
addresses. To not have multicast capability on an interface, this routine
must be set to zero.

4. u_mctest.c file in the inet directory gives a sample of how to set
and get IP options related to Multicasting.  The "ipmc\ipmult.h" file is
used to convert from BSD socket interface into an interface that is
currently supported in the InterNiche stack.  

5. In the menuing interface, it is possible to execute u_mctest against
a peer InterNiche TCP/IP stack that is also IP multicast enabled
and the two sides can send and receive IP multicast packets.
The test program uses blocking sendto and non-blocking recvfrom udp
socket calls. 
It is best to type in u_mctest and hit the return key simultaneously
on both menuing interfaces.

6. In this build, IP multicast packets are mapped to Ethernet broadcast
addresses in et_arp.c.  The implementation of mapping IP multicast to
Ethernet multicast is now under an #ifdef ETHMCAST in et_arp.c.
When the porting engineer has defined n_mcastlist in the ethernet driver
and is ready to implement IP multicast mapping to Ethernet multicast
mapping, this #ifdef ETHMCAST must be defined. 

7. The test module, ipmc\u_mctest.c, has a new flag defined- 
IP_MULTI_UMCTEST.  This flag can be used to conditionally compile the test
program.  If the supporting engineer does not wish to use this test program,
the #define for this flag must be removed from ipmc/u_mctest.c.  In addition
the project directory file that invokes u_mctest_init must be altered to
conditionally compile u_mctest_init,that is, the call to this routine 
must be placed within a #ifdef IP_MULTI_UMCTEST.
